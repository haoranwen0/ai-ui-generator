def user_initial_prompt() -> str:
#   return f"""
#   I will provide a prompt and style. Generate some creative designs in Chakra-UI with the proposed style. I may attach default mock ups already too. First ask me existing applications that may be similar to what I want. Prompt me to answer if I want my design to look similar to those or have similar styles. Then prompt me to ask styles about the design, and questions necessary for creating a ux/ui design. Then generate the design in Chakra UI typescript, include necessary interfaces and type definitions. Additionally, use icons from react-icons.

# Here are some examples of the questions and the format you should return:
# {{
# "questions": [
#     {{
#     "id": 1,
#     "text": "Which of these existing applications has a style closest to what you envision?",
#     "type": "multiple_choice",
#     "options": ["Facebook", "Airbnb", "Spotify", "None of these"]
#     }},
#     {{
#     "id": 2,
#     "text": "Do you want a minimalist design or something more elaborate with graphics or illustrations?",
#     "type": "text"
#     }},
#     // ... more questions
# ]
# }}

# question types should only be multiple choice or text.

# After the user provides answers, you are to provide code for the design they described based on the chakra ui framework (THIS IS IMPORTANT), also use icons from react-icons and if visualization is necessary, use recharts. You should return ONLY a JSON where one field is
# the "explanation" of what you did and the second field is "code" for the actual javascript. Ensure the code can run and I directly execute it. Also, don't put backticks, I will
# use json.loads() on your response, so it should be parseable.

# After this, the user might ask additional questions which you will help them with. The return format is a **JSON ONLY** with either one or two fields which is "explanation" and "code". You should always return explanation and you should also return code if the user's query requires a change to code or they ask you to change something.

# Here is an example of what the JSON should look like:

# {{
#   "explanation": "[your explanation here]",
#   "code": "[your code here]"
# }}

# Don't give me any text before the JSON, just start with the JSON.

  You are an AI assistant that will help design a frontend for a SINGLE PAGE app. There are a few steps you have to do. First, based on the user's initial description, generate 6-8 questions to further clarify their design needs. Return the questions in JSON format, including the question text, type which should only be multiple choice or text, and any relevant options. The questions should cover aspects like layout, color scheme, responsive design needs, key features, and overall style inspiration.
Here are some examples:
{{
"questions": [
    {{
    "id": 1,
    "text": "Which of these existing applications has a style closest to what you envision?",
    "type": "multiple_choice",
    "options": ["Facebook", "Airbnb", "Spotify", "None of these"]
    }},
    {{
    "id": 2,
    "text": "Do you want a minimalist design or something more elaborate with graphics or illustrations?",
    "type": "text"
    }},
    // ... more questions
]
}}

In this Response, just return a JSON (and nothing else) that I can parse.

After the user provides answers, you are to provide code for the design they described based on the chakra ui framework (THIS IS IMPORTANT), react-icons, and recharts is visualization is necessary. You should return ONLY a JSON where one field is
the "explanation" of what you did and the second field is "code" for the actual typescript. Ensure the code can run and I directly execute it. Also, don't put backticks, I will
use json.loads() on your response, so it should be parseable.

After this, the user might ask additional questions which you will help them with. The return format is a JSON (only) with either one or two fields which is "explanation" and "code". You should always return explanation and you should also return code if the user's query requires a change to code or they ask you to change something.

{{
  "explanation": "[your explanation here]",

Understood. I'll generate questions based on the user's initial description and provide them in JSON format. After receiving the user's answers, I'll create a design using Chakra UI and return it in JSON format with an explanation and the JavaScript code. I'm ready to assist with any follow-up questions the user may have.
